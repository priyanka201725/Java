# Question no 1: Define Port, Socket, IP Address and URL.

## `Port`:-

        * Port is a logical construct.

        * Port is a number assigned to a processor running on a server

        * It is a 16-bit number unsigned integer range from (0-65535).

                From (0-1023), known as "system port or widely known port"

                From (1024-49159), known as "Reserved Port"

                Remaining ports(49159-65535), known as the "dynamic port or client port" used by client while connecting to server.


        * Only one application can run in a single port in a server.

        * Ports are used in transport layers.

        * example: HTTPS:80, HTTP:443, FTP:20.

## `Socket`:- 

        * Combination of IP address and Port number is called the the Socket.

        * Socket is the end point for the communication.

        * Different types of the Socket are:

                a. TCP Socket 

                b. Datagram Socket

                c. Raw Socket Interface

        * It works as an interface between an Application layer and Transport Layer


## `IP Addresses`
        
        * An IP Addres is an address having information about how to reach a specific host which is a 32-bit unique address number having an address space of 2 ^ 32.
        
        * InetAddress is a class that allows us to work with the IP Addresses belongs to java.net package.

        * InetAddress is the base class of both Inet4Address(IPv4) and Inet6Address(IPv6)

        * Some of the methods present in InetAddress class are:- 

                a. public static InetAddress getByName(String host) throws UnknownHostException:-

                It returns the instances of the InetAddress class containing the LocalHost IP and Name

                b. public static InetAddress getByAddress(byte IPAdress[]) throws UnknownHostException:-
                
                It returns the instance of the InetAddress class created from the raw IP Address.

                c. public static InetAddress getLocalHost() throws UnknownHostException

                It returns the instances of the InetAddress class containing the localhost name and address

                d. public static InetAddress[] getAllByName(String hostName) throws UnknownHostException

                It returns the array of the instances of the InetAddress class which contains the IP Addresses.


        * Example porgram:- eg/InetAddressExam.java
 


## `URL`


* It is a class that is used to represent URL
* It is a package of java.net.
* A url is devided into the many sections;

* Example program ðŸ’¯

         eg/URLMthod.java

**output://**

         Protocol:- https

         Authority:- www.github.com:3000

         Port Number:- 3000

         Default Port Number:- 443

         Path:- /iamisha

         File:- /iamisha?tab=repositories

         Query String :- tab=repositories

          Anchor/Reference:- git
  
          URI:-https://www.github.com:3000/iamisha?tab=repositories#git

          URL String:- https://www.github.com:3000/iamisha?tab=repositories#git

# Question no 2: Write a program to process URL processing.

## Solution:- 

        eg/URLMethod.java

## Output:- 

        1. Protocal:- https

        2. Host/Domain:- www.github.com

        3. Host Authority:- www.github.com:3000

        4. Port:- 3000

        5. Default Port:- 443

        6. Path:- /iamisha

        7. File:- /iamisha?tab=repositories

        8. Reference/Anchor:- git

        9. Query String:- tab=repositories

        10. URI:- https://www.github.com:3000/iamisha?tab=repositories#git 

# Question no 3: Differentiate between URL and URLConnection class in java

- **URL** is the class that is used to represent a url where the **URLConnection** is the class that is used to represent the communication between  a url and an application.

- **URL** class provides the methods for accessing the various components of the url where **URLConnection** class provides  the links to the sources like web page, and retrieve information about the resource such as content type, content length and last modified date.

- **URL** class is used to represent the address of the resource whereas **URLConnection** class is used to establish a connection to the resource and retrieve information about it.

- The **URL** class is immutable, which means that once it's created, its fields can not be modified. While the **URLConnection** class is mutable, which means that the request properties can be modified before the connection is opened.

- **URL** class example:-

        eg/URLMethod.java

whereas **URLConnection** class example:-

        eg/URLConnectionExam.java
