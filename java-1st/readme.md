# 1. ArithmeticException and InputMismatchException handling

---> ArithmeticException and InputMismatchExcetpion are the types of Unchecked/RunTimeException.

---> The RunTimeException are not checked by the compiler, but directly taken care by JVM.

---> UncheckedException are rarely occured exception so, the compiler doesn't take care very much about these exception.

---> Example program 1:- Division1.java(ArithmeticException)
---> Example program 2:- Division2.java(InputMismatchException)

# 2. Program to print the natural numbers upto 20, numbers that are divisble by 2, and the given condtion that (the number divisible by 3 should give the value Three, number divisible by 5 should give the value Five, number divisible by Three and Five should give the value Your name and other number that are not divisible should be as it is).

----> Answer:- NaturalNum.java (prints the natural numbers upto 20 and prints the even number and also fulfils the given condition).

# 3. Write a JAVA program to write on a file using FileOutputStream.

---> FileOutputStream is byte oriented.
---> We could simply use the try-catch block or we can easily throws the IOException

----> solutin is in :- WriteInFile.java
