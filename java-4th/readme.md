                 ii. public abstract void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e);

                 iii. public abstract void mouseExited(MouseEvent e);

                 iv. public abastract void mousePressed(MouseEvent e);

                 v. public abastract void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e);

        - The Java MouseMotionListener is notified whenever you move or drag mouse.

        - It is also notified agaisnt MouseEvent.

        - it is found in java.awt.event package.

        - It has two methods

                 i. public abstract void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e);

                 ii. public abstract void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e);
