_Java Buffered Streams_

===> It uses the Internal buffer to store the data.

===> It is fast and more efficient.

===> It lies under the java.io package.

===> It is of two different types

a. BufferedInputStream

b. BufferedOutputStream

_Serializable and Deserializable_

1.  The process of storing the data object data into the file is called the serialization and the reverse is called the deserialization.

2.  The class must implement the Serializable interface to write it's objects into file.

3.  ObjectInputStream class with it's method readObject() along with ObjecOutputStream class with it's method writeObject() is used.
